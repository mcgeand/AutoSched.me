# Phased CI Baseline Delivery Strategy Implementation Guide

**Related**: [AUT-89 Spike Decisions](../spikes/AUT-89-phased-delivery-strategy-decisions.md)  
**Status**: Ready for Phase 1 Implementation  
**Owner**: Product Owner with cross-functional coordination

## Overview

This guide provides the practical implementation roadmap for delivering CI baseline value incrementally across four phases, starting with immediate developer value and scaling to operational excellence based on application complexity.

## Phase 1: Basic Development Flow (Week 1-2)

### Immediate Implementation - Basic CI Pipeline

#### GitHub Actions Workflow Setup
```yaml
# .github/workflows/basic-ci.yml
name: Basic CI Pipeline
on:
  pull_request:
    branches: [dev, main]
  push:
    branches: [dev, main]

jobs:
  basic-validation:
    name: Build, Lint, and Test
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    timeout-minutes: 10
    
    steps:
      - name: Checkout code
        uses: actions/checkout@v4
      
      - name: Setup Node.js
        uses: actions/setup-node@v4
        with:
          node-version: '18'
          cache: 'npm'
      
      - name: Install dependencies
        run: npm ci
      
      - name: TypeScript compilation
        run: npm run build
        
      - name: Code linting
        run: npm run lint
        
      - name: Run existing tests
        run: npm run test
        
      - name: Validate build artifacts
        run: |
          if [ ! -d "dist" ]; then
            echo "Build artifacts missing"
            exit 1
          fi
```

#### Package.json Scripts Enhancement
```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "build": "tsc --noEmit && tsc --project tsconfig.build.json",
    "lint": "eslint . --ext .ts,.tsx --max-warnings 0",
    "lint:fix": "eslint . --ext .ts,.tsx --fix",
    "test": "jest --passWithNoTests",
    "test:watch": "jest --watch",
    "ci": "npm run build && npm run lint && npm run test",
    "dev:check": "npm run ci"
  }
}
```

#### Developer Workflow Documentation
```markdown
# Phase 1 CI Workflow Guide

## Before Creating a PR
```bash
# Run all checks locally (matches CI exactly)
npm run ci

# Fix any linting issues
npm run lint:fix

# Ensure tests pass
npm run test
```

## PR Workflow
1. Create PR against `dev` branch
2. CI automatically runs: build → lint → test
3. Green CI = ready for review
4. Red CI = fix issues before review

## Common CI Failures
- **Build failure**: TypeScript compilation errors
- **Lint failure**: Code formatting or ESLint rule violations  
- **Test failure**: Existing tests broken by changes

## Getting Help
- Check CI logs in GitHub Actions tab
- Run `npm run ci` locally to reproduce issues
- Ask in #dev-team for CI-related questions
```

### Phase 1 Success Metrics Setup

#### CI Performance Monitoring
```bash
#!/bin/bash
# scripts/phase1-metrics.sh

# Track CI performance metrics
collect_phase1_metrics() {
  local start_date="$1"
  local end_date="$2"
  
  echo "=== Phase 1 CI Metrics ($start_date to $end_date) ==="
  
  # Success rate
  total_runs=$(gh api "/repos/:owner/:repo/actions/runs" --jq '.workflow_runs | length')
  successful_runs=$(gh api "/repos/:owner/:repo/actions/runs" --jq '.workflow_runs | map(select(.conclusion == "success")) | length')
  success_rate=$(echo "scale=2; $successful_runs * 100 / $total_runs" | bc)
  
  echo "Success rate: $success_rate% ($successful_runs/$total_runs)"
  
  # Average runtime
  avg_runtime=$(gh api "/repos/:owner/:repo/actions/runs" --jq '.workflow_runs | map(.run_started_at, .updated_at) | average')
  echo "Average runtime: $avg_runtime minutes"
  
  # Common failure types
  echo "Common failure types:"
  gh api "/repos/:owner/:repo/actions/runs" --jq '.workflow_runs | map(select(.conclusion == "failure")) | group_by(.name) | map({type: .[0].name, count: length}) | sort_by(.count) | reverse'
}

# Weekly Phase 1 report
generate_phase1_report() {
  echo "# Phase 1 CI Weekly Report"
  echo "**Goal**: >95% successful PR merges"
  echo ""
  
  collect_phase1_metrics "$(date -d '7 days ago' +%Y-%m-%d)" "$(date +%Y-%m-%d)"
  
  echo ""
  echo "## Developer Feedback"
  echo "- Survey developers: Is CI providing value?"
  echo "- Pain points: What's still manual/frustrating?"
  echo "- Phase 2 readiness: Do we need type generation yet?"
}
```

#### Developer Satisfaction Tracking
```typescript
// scripts/developer-survey.ts

interface Phase1Feedback {
  developerName: string;
  weekOf: string;
  responses: {
    ciValueRating: 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5; // 1=no value, 5=very valuable
    mergeConfidence: 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5; // 1=not confident, 5=very confident
    painPoints: string[];
    suggestedImprovements: string[];
    phase2Readiness: 'not_needed' | 'would_help' | 'desperately_needed';
  };
}

// Weekly developer feedback collection
const collectPhase1Feedback = async (): Promise<Phase1Feedback[]> => {
  // Simple survey link or Slack poll
  // Focus on: Is basic CI providing value? What's still painful?
};
```

## Phase 2: Type Safety & Quality (Week 3-4)

### Trigger Criteria for Phase 2
```typescript
// Phase 2 readiness assessment
interface Phase2ReadinessCriteria {
  phase1Success: {
    ciSuccessRate: number; // Must be >95%
    developerSatisfaction: number; // Must be >4/5
    avgCiRuntime: number; // Must be <3 minutes
  };
  
  applicationComplexity: {
    apiEndpointCount: number; // Suggest >5 endpoints
    typeComplexity: boolean; // Manual type management becoming painful
    frontendBackendMismatches: number; // >2 incidents per week
  };
  
  teamReadiness: {
    backendDevAvailable: boolean;
    frontendDevAvailable: boolean;
    phase1Stable: boolean; // No major CI issues for 1 week
  };
}

const assessPhase2Readiness = (): boolean => {
  // Evaluate criteria and recommend Phase 2 timing
  // Should be driven by real pain points, not timeline
};
```

### Phase 2 Implementation Plan (When Triggered)
```yaml
# Enhanced CI with generator pipeline (from AUT-85 decisions)
name: CI with Type Generation
jobs:
  build-and-generate:
    steps:
      # Phase 1 steps...
      
      - name: Generate OpenAPI spec
        run: npm run gen:openapi
        
      - name: Generate frontend types
        run: npm run gen:api-types
        
      - name: Check for drift
        run: |
          if ! git diff --exit-code; then
            echo "Generated files have uncommitted changes (drift detected)"
            exit 2
          fi
```

## Phase 3: Security & Testing (Week 5-6)

### Trigger Criteria for Phase 3
```typescript
interface Phase3ReadinessCriteria {
  securityNeeds: {
    productionTraffic: boolean;
    sensitiveDataHandling: boolean;
    externalIntegrations: boolean;
    complianceRequirements: boolean;
  };
  
  testingNeeds: {
    integrationTestCount: number; // >10 meaningful integration tests
    databaseComplexity: boolean; // Multiple tables, migrations
    testFlakiness: number; // Manual testing becoming bottleneck
  };
  
  teamCapacity: {
    securitySpecialistAvailable: boolean;
    databaseSpecialistAvailable: boolean;
    qaAnalystCapacity: boolean;
  };
}
```

### Phase 3 Implementation Plan (When Triggered)

- Implement AUT-86 database testing architecture
- Add comprehensive test suite with reliable CI integration

## Phase 4: Operational Excellence (Week 7+)

### Trigger Criteria for Phase 4
```typescript
interface Phase4ReadinessCriteria {
  operationalNeeds: {
    ciFailureVolume: number; // Enough failures to justify escalation
    teamCoordinationComplexity: boolean; // Multi-team coordination issues
    incidentResponseNeeds: boolean; // Production issues requiring CI reliability
  };
  
  teamMaturity: {
    allSpecialistsAvailable: boolean;
    processDocumentationComplete: boolean;
    onCallRotationEstablished: boolean;
  };
}
```

### Phase 4 Implementation Plan (When Triggered)
- Implement AUT-88 escalation matrix decisions
- Full monitoring and alerting infrastructure
- Comprehensive operational procedures

## Cross-Phase Implementation Guidelines

### Developer Communication Strategy
```markdown
# Phase Transition Communication

## Phase 1 Launch
**Subject**: New Basic CI Pipeline - Green Dev Status!
**Message**: 
- CI now validates all PRs: build + lint + test
- Run `npm run ci` locally before creating PRs
- Green CI = ready for review, Red CI = fix first
- Questions? #dev-team channel

## Phase 2 Consideration
**Subject**: Considering Enhanced CI - Type Generation
**Message**:
- Phase 1 CI working well (>95% success rate!)
- Evaluating automatic type generation for API changes
- Survey: Are manual type updates becoming painful?
- Timeline: Only if real pain points identified

## Phase 3+ Planning
- Only communicate when triggered by real needs
- Focus on solving actual problems, not theoretical ones
```

### Technical Debt Management
```typescript
// Technical debt tracking across phases
interface TechnicalDebtItem {
  phase: 1 | 2 | 3 | 4;
  description: string;
  impact: 'low' | 'medium' | 'high';
  resolvedBy: 'next_phase' | 'future_spike' | 'separate_work';
}

const phase1TechnicalDebt: TechnicalDebtItem[] = [
  {
    phase: 1,
    description: "Manual type checking between API and Frontend",
    impact: 'medium',
    resolvedBy: 'next_phase' // Phase 2 adds generators
  },
  {
    phase: 1, 
    description: "No security scanning",
    impact: 'low', // Currently low due to no production traffic
    resolvedBy: 'future_spike' // Phase 3 when security becomes important
  }
];
```

rollback_to_previous_phase() {
  local current_phase="$1"
  local reason="$2"
  
  case $current_phase in
    2)
      echo "Rolling back Phase 2 to Phase 1..."
      # Disable generator pipeline, keep basic CI
      git revert --no-edit HEAD~5..HEAD  # Rollback Phase 2 commits
      # Communicate to teams about rollback
      ;;
    3)
      echo "Rolling back Phase 3 to Phase 2..."
      # Disable security/database testing, keep generators
      ;;
    4)
      echo "Rolling back Phase 4 to Phase 3..."
      # Disable escalation procedures, keep core functionality
      ;;
  esac
  
  echo "Rollback completed. Reason: $reason"
  # Update stakeholders about rollback and next steps
}
```

## Monitoring and Success Tracking

### Cross-Phase Metrics Dashboard
```javascript
// Phased delivery metrics tracking
class PhasedDeliveryMetrics {
  trackPhaseProgression() {
    return {
      currentPhase: this.getCurrentPhase(),
      phaseStartDate: this.getPhaseStartDate(),
      successCriteriaMet: this.validateSuccessCriteria(),
      nextPhaseReadiness: this.assessNextPhaseReadiness(),
      developerSatisfaction: this.collectDeveloperFeedback(),
      technicalMetrics: this.getCIMetrics()
    };
  }
  
  generatePhaseReport() {
    // Weekly report on phase progress
    // Include: success metrics, readiness assessment, next steps
  }
}
```
