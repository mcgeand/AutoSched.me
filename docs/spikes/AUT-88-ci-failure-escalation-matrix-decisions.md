# AUT-88: CI Failure Escalation Matrix - Decision Record

**Date**: 2025-08-16  
**Participants**: QA Analyst (lead), All Specialists, Scrum Master  
**Status**: ✅ Decisions Finalized  
**Related**: [AUT-9 CI Baseline](../../ops/linear/README.md)

## Problem Statement

AUT-9 CI baseline will introduce multiple failure points across domains. We need clear escalation paths to prevent developer blockers and ensure fast resolution across Generator Pipeline (AUT-85), Test Database Architecture (AUT-86), and Security Scanning Integration (AUT-87).

## Key Decisions Made

### 1. Comprehensive Failure Type Categorization

**Decision**: **Domain-based failure ownership with clear escalation paths and SLA targets**

**Generator Drift Failures** (from AUT-85):
- **Primary Owner**: Backend Developer (OpenAPI generation issues)
- **Secondary Owner**: Frontend Developer (type generation issues)
- **QA Role**: Validate fix doesn't break existing API contracts
- **SLA Target**: 2 hours (blocks all development)
- **Override Criteria**: Never - drift indicates real contract issues

**Test Failures** (from AUT-86):
- **Unit Test Failures**: Code author (4 hours SLA)
- **Integration Test Failures**: Backend Developer (8 hours SLA)
- **Database Test Failures**: Database Specialist (4-8 hours based on complexity)
- **QA Role**: Verify test validity, not just fix to make tests pass
- **Override**: Only for critical production hotfixes with Linear tracking

**Security Scan Failures** (from AUT-87):
- **Critical/High Vulnerabilities**: Security Specialist + Code Author (24 hours SLA)
- **Secret Detection**: Security Specialist + Original Committer (1 hour SLA)
- **Override Policy**: Zero tolerance for secrets, conditional for vulnerabilities with team approval

**Infrastructure Issues**:
- **CI Runner Problems**: DevOps Specialist (1 hour SLA)
- **Database Connectivity**: DevOps + Database Specialist (30 minutes SLA)
- **Override**: Supported when root cause identified and fix in progress

**Build/Compilation Failures**:
- **Owner**: Code author who introduced failing change
- **QA Role**: Verify fix doesn't introduce new functional issues
- **SLA**: 2 hours (straightforward to fix)
- **Override**: Rarely needed - usually quick fixes

**Performance Regressions**:
- **Owner**: Depends on which component regressed
- **QA Role**: Validate performance test accuracy and realistic expectations
- **SLA**: 24 hours (requires investigation)
- **Override**: If regression <20% and fix timeline established

### 2. Escalation Communication Strategy

**Decision**: **Multi-tier notification system preventing alert fatigue while ensuring rapid response**

**Immediate Escalation** (Slack + Linear ticket):
- **Security failures**: Secret detection, critical vulnerabilities
- **Infrastructure failures**: CI runners down, database unreachable
- **Generator drift**: API contract mismatches blocking all teams

**4-Hour Escalation** (Linear ticket):
- **Test failures**: Unit, integration tests failing
- **Build failures**: Compilation, linting errors
- **Performance regression**: >20% degradation

**Daily Standup Escalation**:
- **Persistent issues**: Any failure >SLA without resolution plan
- **Pattern recognition**: Multiple similar failures indicating systemic issues

**Communication Workflow Integration**:
```
Failure Detection → Domain Expert Notification → Cross-Team Impact Assessment → SLA Timer Activation → Resolution Tracking
```

### 3. Override and Bypass Procedures

**Decision**: **Risk-based override policy with strict accountability and tracking**

**Override Never Allowed**:
- **Secret detection**: Credential security cannot be bypassed
- **API contract drift**: Breaks integration between teams
- **Critical security vulnerabilities**: Security policy violation
- **Authentication/OAuth changes**: Security critical systems

**Override With Approval Required**:
- **Infrastructure issues**: When root cause identified and fix in progress
- **Test environment problems**: Not affecting actual code quality
- **Performance regression**: <20% with tracked remediation plan
- **False positives**: After thorough security/technical analysis

**Override Process**:
1. **QA validates** that bypass is safe (no actual code quality issues)
2. **Linear ticket created** with timeline for proper fix
3. **Slack notification** to relevant team about temporary bypass
4. **Scrum Master tracking** to ensure fix doesn't get forgotten
5. **Post-override monitoring** to ensure issue resolution

### 4. SLA Targets and Performance Integration

**Decision**: **Realistic SLA targets based on complexity and team capacity**

**Critical Path SLAs** (Block all development):
- **Generator drift**: 2 hours
- **Secret detection**: 1 hour  
- **Infrastructure failures**: 30 minutes (CI runners), 1 hour (database)

**Standard Development SLAs**:
- **Build failures**: 2 hours
- **Unit test failures**: 4 hours
- **Security vulnerabilities**: 24 hours (critical/high), 7 days (medium)

**Complex Investigation SLAs**:
- **Integration test failures**: 8 hours
- **Database schema issues**: 4-8 hours (based on complexity)
- **Performance regressions**: 24 hours

**SLA Integration with Previous Spikes**:
- **AUT-85 Generator Pipeline**: 2-hour SLA aligns with 8-second performance target
- **AUT-86 Database Architecture**: Infrastructure SLAs support container reliability
- **AUT-87 Security Integration**: Security SLAs match vulnerability remediation timeframes

### 5. Automated Fallout Ticket Creation

**Decision**: **Pattern-based automation for systemic issue tracking**

**Infrastructure Fallout Tickets** (Auto-created):
- **Repeated container failures**: DevOps infrastructure hardening ticket
- **Database connectivity patterns**: DB connection pool optimization ticket
- **Security tool API limits**: DevOps rate limit management ticket
- **Performance regression trends**: Cross-domain performance analysis ticket

**Process Fallout Tickets** (Scrum Master discretion):
- **High override usage**: Process improvement ticket (>2 overrides/week)
- **SLA miss patterns**: Tooling improvement ticket for specific failure types
- **Cross-team coordination issues**: Communication process refinement ticket

**Technical Debt Fallout** (Senior Dev Triage assessment):
- **Flaky test patterns**: Test reliability improvement ticket
- **Generator complexity issues**: API contract simplification ticket
- **Build performance degradation**: Build optimization ticket

## Implementation Architecture

### CI Pipeline Failure Detection and Routing
```yaml
# Failure detection and escalation workflow
failure_detection:
  categorization:
    - generator_drift: backend_dev, frontend_dev
    - security_scan: security_specialist
    - test_failure: code_author, qa_analyst
    - infrastructure: devops_specialist
    - build_error: code_author
    - performance: domain_specialist
  
  notification_routing:
    immediate: [security_secrets, infrastructure_critical, generator_drift]
    standard: [test_failures, build_errors, security_standard]
    investigation: [performance_regression, complex_integration]
```

### Auto-Retry Logic Integration
```yaml
# Intelligent retry logic from CI/CD specialist input
auto_retry_policy:
  infrastructure_failures:
    max_attempts: 3
    backoff: exponential
    conditions: [container_startup, external_api_timeout, network_connectivity]
  
  never_retry:
    - secret_detection
    - security_vulnerabilities
    - test_failures
    - generator_drift
    - build_errors
  
  conditional_retry:
    database_connectivity: 
      condition: other_jobs_succeeding
      max_attempts: 2
    performance_regression:
      condition: infrastructure_metrics_normal
      max_attempts: 1
```

### Real-Time Dashboard Integration
```javascript
// CI health dashboard components
const dashboardConfig = {
  realTimeStatus: {
    pipelineSuccess: "percentage by job type",
    slaCountdown: "time remaining before escalation",
    teamOwnership: "who owns each failure type",
    performanceTrend: "historical performance with regression detection"
  },
  
  escalationTracking: {
    activeFailures: "current failures with ownership and SLA status",
    overrideUsage: "weekly override metrics by team",
    resolutionProgress: "fix progress tracking with timeline updates"
  }
};
```
