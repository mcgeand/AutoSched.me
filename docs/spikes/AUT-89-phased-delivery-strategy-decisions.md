# AUT-89: Phased Delivery Strategy for CI Baseline - Decision Record

**Date**: 2025-08-16  
**Participants**: Product Owner (lead), Project Manager, CI/CD Specialist, Scrum Master  
**Status**: ✅ Decisions Finalized  
**Related**: [AUT-9 CI Baseline](../../ops/linear/README.md)

## Problem Statement

AUT-9 CI baseline has significant cross-team dependencies that could create a delivery bottleneck with "big bang" implementation. We need phased delivery to reduce coordination complexity and deliver immediate developer value.

## Key Decisions Made

### 1. Incremental Value Delivery Strategy

**Decision**: **Start simple, add complexity based on real application needs, avoid over-engineering upfront**

**Rationale**: 
- Current codebase is not complex enough to justify advanced CI infrastructure
- Developers need immediate "green dev" status more than comprehensive tooling
- Coordination complexity increases exponentially with simultaneous multi-team implementation
- Early value delivery validates approach and provides learning for future phases

### 2. MVP CI Baseline Definition

**Decision**: **"Green Dev" Success Criteria - Basic Development Flow**

**MVP Scope (Phase 1)**:
```
Given: A developer creates a PR with basic code changes
When: CI pipeline runs  
Then:
  - ✅ Code compiles and builds successfully
  - ✅ Basic linting passes (formatting, syntax)
  - ✅ Type safety validated (no TypeScript compile errors)
  - ⚠️ Optional: Simple unit tests (if they exist)
```

**Explicitly NOT in MVP**:
- ❌ Complex generator pipeline (manual initially)
- ❌ Comprehensive security scanning (address later)
- ❌ Database integration tests (too complex initially)
- ❌ Performance monitoring (optimization comes later)
- ❌ Advanced escalation matrix (basic notifications only)

**Business Value**: Immediate developer confidence in PR merge process, prevent broken code from blocking team

### 3. Four-Phase Delivery Strategy

**Decision**: **Incremental complexity based on application growth and real pain points**

#### Phase 1: Basic Development Flow (Week 1-2)
**Value**: Developers can merge code confidently  
**Scope**: Build + Lint + TypeScript compilation + Basic tests  
**Team**: DevOps + CI/CD + QA (3 specialists)  
**Success Metric**: >95% successful PR merges  
**Dependencies**: None - can start immediately  
**Risk**: Low - proven technology, simple implementation

#### Phase 2: Type Safety & Quality (Week 3-4)
**Value**: Prevent API/Frontend integration issues  
**Scope**: Implement AUT-85 generator pipeline decisions  
**Team**: + Backend + Frontend (5 specialists total)  
**Success Metric**: Zero type mismatches in production  
**Dependencies**: Phase 1 stable foundation  
**Risk**: Medium - requires coordination, well-defined scope

#### Phase 3: Security & Testing (Week 5-6)
**Value**: Catch security issues and test regressions  
**Scope**: Implement AUT-87 security scanning + AUT-86 database testing  
**Team**: + Security + Database (7 specialists total)  
**Success Metric**: Zero critical security findings, >80% test coverage  
**Dependencies**: Phase 1+2 operational  
**Risk**: Medium-High - complex integration points

#### Phase 4: Operational Excellence (Week 7+)
**Value**: Proactive issue detection and resolution  
**Scope**: Full AUT-88 escalation matrix + monitoring  
**Team**: All specialists (8 total)  
**Success Metric**: <2 hour mean time to resolution  
**Dependencies**: Phase 1+2+3 proven  
**Risk**: High - full coordination complexity

### 4. Spike Decision Integration Strategy

**Decision**: **Preserve AUT-85 through AUT-88 decisions as future implementation roadmap, not immediate requirements**

**AUT-85 Generator Pipeline**: Implement in Phase 2 when API complexity increases  
**AUT-86 Database Architecture**: Implement in Phase 3 when test suite becomes substantial  
**AUT-87 Security Integration**: Implement in Phase 3 when attack surface grows  
**AUT-88 Escalation Matrix**: Implement in Phase 4 when team coordination becomes complex

**Rationale**: All spike decisions remain valid, but timing aligned with actual application complexity and team needs

### 5. Risk Mitigation Strategy

**Decision**: **Learning-based iteration with early value validation**

**Primary Risk**: Over-engineering upfront when application doesn't justify complexity  
**Mitigation**: Start with minimal implementation, add features based on real pain points

**Coordination Risk**: Multi-team blocking with big bang approach  
**Mitigation**: Reduced coordination surface area per phase, stable foundation building

**Technical Risk**: Complex integration issues  
**Mitigation**: Isolate issues to specific phases, easier troubleshooting

**Business Risk**: Delayed value delivery  
**Mitigation**: Immediate developer value in Phase 1, incremental improvements

## Implementation Architecture

### Phase 1 Technical Implementation
```yaml
# .github/workflows/basic-ci.yml
name: Basic CI
on: [pull_request]
jobs:
  basic-validation:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - uses: actions/setup-node@v4
      - run: npm ci
      - run: npm run build    # TypeScript compilation
      - run: npm run lint     # ESLint + Prettier  
      - run: npm run test     # Jest (existing tests only)
```

### Evolution Trigger Points
```typescript
// Phase progression criteria
interface PhaseReadiness {
  phase2: {
    apiComplexity: "multiple endpoints with complex types";
    frontendIntegration: "type safety becomes developer pain point";
    teamFeedback: "manual type checking is slowing development";
  };
  
  phase3: {
    securitySurface: "production traffic or sensitive data";
    testComplexity: "integration tests become necessary";
    dataComplexity: "database schema evolution needed";
  };
  
  phase4: {
    teamSize: "coordination becomes bottleneck";
    ciVolume: "enough failures to justify escalation procedures";
    operationalNeeds: "incident response procedures required";
  };
}
```

## Resource Allocation Benefits

### Traditional "Big Bang" Approach (Avoided)
- **Week 1-6**: All 8 specialists busy simultaneously
- **High coordination overhead**: Daily sync meetings required
- **Integration risk**: Everything must work together immediately
- **Delayed value**: No benefits until week 6

### Phased Approach (Selected)
- **Week 1-2**: 3 specialists focused, others available for other priorities
- **Week 3-4**: 5 specialists, building on stable foundation
- **Week 5-6**: 7 specialists, with proven CI foundation
- **Lower coordination overhead**: Smaller teams per phase
- **Early value**: Immediate developer benefits from week 2
