## Referencing Linear issues in PRs

- Include the Linear issue key in PR titles and descriptions to keep work traceable.
- Title example: `[API] Implement booking POST (AS-123)`
- Description example: `Linear: AS-123` plus a short summary and acceptance criteria reference.

## Linear usage quick start

- Work is managed in Linear using Issues, Cycles (sprints), and Projects/Epics.
- Use fields: Priority (P0/P1/P2), Domain (fe, api, db, docker, oauth, ci, qa, sec, release, ux, senior, ops), Milestone (M1–M5), Sprint (Cycle), Risk (R/Y/G).
- Status flow: Triage → Todo → In Progress → In Review → QA → Done/Blocked.
