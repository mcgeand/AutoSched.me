Trigger: `triage tickets`

Tasks:
1) Review Linear backlog and `/ops/tasks/*.md` updated since last run
2) Identify dependencies and missing work
3) Create fallout issues in Linear per domain (API, FE, DB, DevOps, Security, CI)
4) Assign owners and set `status` and estimates
5) Update acceptance criteria clarity

Output:
- For each ticket: a brief triage note, fallout ticket IDs/owners
- Risks list and unknowns

Guardrails:
- Do not implement; prepare work for execution
